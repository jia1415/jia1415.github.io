						<h2>A little about me</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						I'm a senior studying <b>mechanical engineering</b> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
						I want to make a positive impact on the world through my work and I'm actively seeking a full time job to start after I graduate in May 2021.
						I love learning, and I'm always looking for ways to grow with new experiences.
						When I'm not studying or working, you can find me sailing on the Charles River, tinkering with my custom PC, or playing video games with my brothers in Theta Xi.
