                    Here, you can find summaries for some of the projects that I've done over the years.
                    Most of these are things that I did for classes, clubs, research, or just for fun. 
                    I haven't been the best at documenting what I've done so I only have brief summaries right now.
                    This page is a work in progress and I'll add more projects as I do them.
                    I will also be creating full writeups that go through the entire design and build process of all my existing projects as soon as I find the time.

                        <p> I am the responsible engineer for the High Altitude DEployment System (HADES) on the MIT Rocket Team. 
                            This system is designed to reliably separate the rocket at high altitude and deploy the drogue parachute.
                            At a high level, HADES uses an explosive charge contained inside a piston to break nylon shear pins and push the two halves of the rocket apart.
                            This system was succesfully deployed during the flight of Hermes 1 and will be used on future missions such as Hermes 3 and Spaceshot.

                        <p> As part of the propulsion subteam on the MIT Rocket Team, I help design, manufacture, and analyze solid rocket motors.
                            In the two years since I've joined, we've gone from 98mm N-class motors with an impulse of 10,000 Ns to 152mm P-Class motors with an impulse of 74,000 Ns.
                            The journey has been bumpy with and we've had multiple mishaps, but the failures taught us a lot about rocket motor design.

                        <p> I perform research on sensors at the MIT Biomimetics Robotics Laboratory. 
                            Some of my work includes wiring and testing sensor electronic components, designing molds for the rubber and polymer parts of the sensor, 
                            and collecting data on sensor attributes.
                            These sensors are designed to be cheap, resiliant, and highly accurate.

                        <p> I took 2.007 where we designed and built robots to compete on a gameboard.
                            Each task on the board is assigned a certain number of points and we have to decide what strategy to adopt.
                            As part of the NEET program, I competed in a special section of 2.007 that had its own board and a larger emphasis on programming and automation.
                            My strategy revolved around pulling a handle to lift a heavy object, a task which had an extremely high point total.

                        <p> I've always liked PC hardware and I wanted a challenge so I decided to do a small form factor watercooled build.
                            I had a Vega 56 and Ryzen 1700 in a Ghost S1 cooled by a single 240mm radiator. 
                            I didn't want to use a pump block combo so I devised a system using a DDC pump and a custom industrial 12v power supply 
                            in the place of the standard SFX power supply. 
                        </p>
