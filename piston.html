When I joined the MIT Rocket Team in my freshman year, the team had just competed in IREC 2017.
We launched two rockets, Raziel and Virgo. 
Raziel had a target altitude of 10,000 feet and Virgo had a target altitude of 30,000 feet. 
Both rockets used a compressedcold gas canister to separate and deploy the drogue.
A black powder charge would be used to deploy the main. 
Although Raziel won second place in its category for IREC, both rockets' recovery systems failed.
